# Silk-protein-polymer3D

Silk protein project - Physics of Life - University of York

## Motivation
Silk is a complex polymer material that is formed through the self-assembly of polypeptide
chains. This process is driven by the nucleation of crystalline domains in flow, 
which may occur when a critical concentration of sufficiently stretched
chains is reached. Previous work  showed that the critical specific work
to reach this condition is reduced by intermolecular associations. A key question is how the number of
associating groups, `stickersâ€™, and their distribution along the backbone of the chain may
optimise this process. We here address this question by extending the [previous work](https://pubs.aip.org/sor/jor/article/66/3/515/2846138/Theoretical-rheo-physics-of-silk-Intermolecular) and simulate the response of coarse-grained sticky polymers inextensional flow for various chain sequences.

## Data

For the first part of the analysis, in the linear regime, data can be found in [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tZkMPG4S_jBB37mcLRI-eiOQJIe5Ptc_?usp=share_link).
- Nature of the data: Synthetic data produced with the [Viking Cluster](https://vikingdocs.york.ac.uk/) at York.
